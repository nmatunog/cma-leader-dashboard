# Push the Fix to Vercel

## 🚨 Current Issue

Vercel is still using the old `package.json` with invalid `@radix-ui` versions because the fix hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet.

## ✅ Solution: Push the Fixed package.json

The fix is already committed locally. You just need to push it to GitHub, which will trigger a new Vercel deployment.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/nmatunog2/2CMA/cma-leader-dashboard

# Verify the fix is in package.json
grep "@radix-ui" package.json

# Push to GitHub (this will trigger Vercel to redeploy)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel to Redeploy

After pushing:
- Vercel will automatically detect the push (if auto-deploy is enabled)
- It will start a new deployment
- The build should now succeed with the fixed package versions

### Step 3: Monitor the Build

1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Watch the new deployment
3. Check that `npm install` succeeds
4. Verify the build completes

## What Was Fixed

The `package.json` was updated from invalid versions to valid ones:

**Before (Invalid):**
```json
"@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.15",      ❌ Doesn't exist
"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.1.16", ❌ Doesn't exist
"@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.2.8",      ❌ Doesn't exist
"@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.2.4",       ❌ Doesn't exist
```

**After (Valid):**
```json
"@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.2",      ✅ Valid
"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.1.2", ✅ Valid
"@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.1.0",      ✅ Valid
"@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.1.0",       ✅ Valid
```

## If Auto-Deploy is Not Enabled

If Vercel doesn't automatically deploy after the push:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or click "Deploy" → "Deploy to Production"

---

## Verify It Works

After the new deployment:

1. ✅ Check build logs - `npm install` should succeed
2. ✅ No more `ETARGET` errors
3. ✅ Build completes successfully
4. ✅ Site is live

---

**Just push to GitHub and Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fixed versions!**

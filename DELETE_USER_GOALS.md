# Delete Goals for Specific User

## ✅ Feature Added

I've added a new feature to delete strategic planning goals for a specific user by email address.

## How to Use

1. **Login as Admin** (nmatunog@gmail.com)
2. **Go to:** `/admin/import` page
3. **Look for:** "Delete Goals for Specific User" section (orange border, above "Clear All Goals")
4. **Enter email:** `nmatunog@gmail.com`
5. **Click:** "Delete Goals for This User"
6. **Confirm:** Click "Yes, Delete Goals"

## What It Does

- Finds the user by email address
- Gets their UID (user ID)
- Deletes all strategic planning goals associated with that UID
- Shows how many goals were deleted

## After Deployment

Once the deployment completes, you can:
1. Go to the admin import page
2. Use the new "Delete Goals for Specific User" section
3. Enter your email and delete your pre-encoded data

**The feature is committed and will be available after the current deployment completes!**

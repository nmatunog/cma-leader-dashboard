## Important

- You need to check all 3 for each variable
- They're usually already pre-selected (check to confirm)
- Select all 3 environments: Production, Preview, Development

## Still Can't Find It?

1. Make sure you're in **Settings** → **Environment Variables** (not Build Settings)
2. Click the **"Add New"** button first (the checkboxes appear in the popup/form)
3. The form should show the environment selection below the Value field

**That's it! The environment selection is in the form when you add a new variable.**

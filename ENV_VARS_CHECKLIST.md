## Answer: Do You Need to Add Them Again?

**NO!** ✅

If you already added them, they are saved. Just verify they're all there using the checklist above.

You only need to add them again if:
- ❌ They're missing from the list
- ❌ You want to change the values
- ❌ They were never added in the first place

**Check now and confirm all 6 are there!**
